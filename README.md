My entry for NaNoGenMo 2019

This project is an exploration of text generation techniques using Homestuck chatlogs as a corpus. The goal is to generate
a novel in the style of a long chatlog conversation.

It will eventually contain at least four parts:
- A web scraper to build the corpus
- Data wrangling to make the corpus more practical for deep learning
- A deep learning model and generator
- A 50,000 word novel generated by the generator!
